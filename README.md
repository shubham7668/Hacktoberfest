## 🧭 Rules  

### 1️⃣ No DSA Codes ❌  
Do **not** submit DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) codes or basic coding problem solutions.  
Such submissions will be marked as **spam** and may **disqualify you from Hacktoberfest** participation.

---

### 2️⃣ What You Can Contribute ✅  
You can contribute in one of the following ways:

- 🧩 **Create a webpage** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (perfect for beginners).  
- ⚙️ **Contribute to the current project** — improve the **PowerShell Showcase** (UI, responsiveness, scripts, or new features).  
- 💻 **Work on your own project** — it can be based on:
  - 📱 Android  
  - 🌐 Web Development  
  - 🤖 Machine Learning  
  - ⚙️ Robotics  
  - 🐍 Python  
  - 🧠 Any other tech stack (as long as it’s functional and adds value)

💡 Make sure your contribution is **meaningful**, **functional**, and **worthy enough** to be merged.

---

### 3️⃣ Add Snapshots or Deployment Link 🖼️  
Every project submission must include **one** of the following:
- 📸 Screenshots of your working project, **or**
- 🔗 A deployed/live link (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

This helps reviewers verify your work quickly and fairly.

---

### 4️⃣ Follow & Support 🌟  
- Make sure to **follow [Shubham](https://github.com/shubham7668)** on GitHub.  
- Don’t forget to **star ⭐ the repository** to show your support and help it grow.

---

### ⚠️ Note  
- 🚫 Do **not** push incomplete or non-working projects.  
- 🕵️ All submissions will be **reviewed thoroughly** before approval.  
- 🧨 Pull requests violating these rules will be marked as **invalid/spam**.

---

> 🧠 **Tip:** Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file carefully before opening a Pull Request to ensure fast approval!

## ➕ How to add a new script (docs/scripts.json)

To add a new PowerShell script to the showcase, edit `docs/scripts.json` and add an object with these fields:

- name (string) — human friendly title  
- description (string) — short summary of the script  
- code (string) — the script body (use `\n` for new lines inside the JSON string)  
- github (string, optional) — a link to the source or reference repo/file  
- demoOutput (string, optional) — the text that will be typed into the demo console

Example entry:
```
{
  "name": "Clean Temp Folder",
  "description": "Remove old files from %TEMP%",
  "code": "Get-ChildItem $env:TEMP -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) } | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse",
  "github": "https://github.com/your/repo/blob/main/clean-temp.ps1",
  "demoOutput": "Removed 42 files"
}
```

Notes:
- When testing locally, serve `docs/` over HTTP (e.g. `npx http-server docs`) because `fetch('scripts.json')` will fail on file://.
- Keep `code` as a single JSON string; escape newlines (`\n`) and quotes as needed.
- Add meaningful descriptions and demoOutput to improve reviewer experience.
